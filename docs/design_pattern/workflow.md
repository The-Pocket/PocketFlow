# Workflow

Many real-world tasks are too complex for one LLM call. The solution is to **Task Decomposition**: decompose them into a [chain](../core_abstraction/flow.md) of multiple Nodes.

> - You don't want to make each task **too coarse**, because it may be _too complex for one LLM call_.
> - You don't want to make each task **too granular**, because then _the LLM call doesn't have enough context_ and results are _not consistent across nodes_.
>
> You usually need multiple _iterations_ to find the _sweet spot_. If the task has too many _edge cases_, consider using [Agents](./agent.md).

### Example: Article Writing

```python
class GenerateOutline(Node):
    def prep(self, shared): return shared["topic"]
    def exec(self, topic): return call_llm(f"Create a detailed outline for an article about {topic}")
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res): shared["outline"] = exec_res

class WriteSection(Node):
    def prep(self, shared): return shared["outline"]
    def exec(self, outline): return call_llm(f"Write content based on this outline: {outline}")
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res): shared["draft"] = exec_res

class ReviewAndRefine(Node):
    def prep(self, shared): return shared["draft"]
    def exec(self, draft): return call_llm(f"Review and improve this draft: {draft}")
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res): shared["final_article"] = exec_res

# Connect nodes
outline = GenerateOutline()
write = WriteSection()
review = ReviewAndRefine()

outline >> write >> review

# Create and run flow
writing_flow = Flow(start=outline)
shared = {"topic": "AI Safety"}
writing_flow.run(shared)
```

For _dynamic cases_, consider using [Agents](./agent.md).
